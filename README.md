# PasswordGenerator

PasswordGenerator is a personal project I made for the sake of building on my proficiency in web development using the following programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
With PasswordGenerator, users can generate passwords with customized attributes such as the password length and the usage of alphanumeric characters and symbols.

Features of PasswordGenerator include:
- Generating passwords
- Copying passwords
- Hiding passwords in text field where they are displayed
- Selecting length of password between 1-30 characters
- Enable different types of characters in the password such as alphanumerics and symbols such as '!' and '?'.
